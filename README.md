📌 Project OverviewThis project develops an automated system to identify the native language (L1) of Indian English speakers based on their accent. It leverages both traditional signal processing (MFCCs) and modern Self-Supervised Learning (HuBERT) to classify speakers into regional groups (e.g., Malayalam, Tamil, Hindi, Kannada, Telugu).The project culminates in a real-world "Accent-Aware Cuisine Recommendation System", which suggests regional dishes based on the detected accent of the user.🚀 Key Features & TasksTask 1: Native Language Identification ModelObjective: Build and compare classifiers for Indian accents.Methods:Baseline: Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained on MFCC features.Deep Learning: SVM trained on HuBERT (Hidden-Unit BERT) embeddings.Layer-wise Analysis: Investigated all 12 transformer layers of HuBERT to find the best layer for accent detection.Result: Achieved >99% accuracy on the sentence-level dataset.Task 2: Generalization Across Age GroupsObjective: Test if the model (trained on Indian Adults) generalizes to Child speech.Experiment: Evaluated the adult model on the SpeechOcean762 dataset (Mandarin children).Finding: The model demonstrated significant domain mismatch, proving that accent identification models are sensitive to vocal tract differences (pitch/formants) between adults and children.Task 3: Linguistic Level Analysis (Word vs. Sentence)Objective: Compare accent detection performance on full sentences versus isolated words.Method: Used CTC-Segmentation (Wav2Vec2 ASR) to force-align audio and extract 43,000+ word-level samples.Finding: Sentence-level classification (99.5%) significantly outperforms word-level classification (94.1%), highlighting the importance of prosody and context.Task 4: Cuisine Recommendation ApplicationObjective: Demonstrate a real-world use case.Tech Stack: Built with Gradio for the web interface.Functionality: Records user audio $\rightarrow$ Detects Accent $\rightarrow$ Recommends regional food (e.g., Kerala Accent $\rightarrow$ Appam, Puttu).📂 Repository StructureFileDescriptionTask1.ipynbModel Development: Feature extraction (MFCC/HuBERT), Model Training, and Layer-wise Analysis.Task2.ipynbAge Generalization: Testing the adult model on child speech data.Task3.ipynbLinguistic Analysis: Word-level segmentation, feature extraction, and comparison.Task4.ipynbApplication: The Gradio-based "Cuisine Recommendation" web app.requirements.txtList of Python dependencies required to run the project.README.mdProject documentation (this file).🛠️ Installation & UsagePrerequisitesThis project requires Python 3.8+ and a GPU environment (Google Colab T4 recommended).1.
